# Task ID: 5
# Title: Fix data synchronization and type comparison issues
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Resolve type comparison problems (Decimal vs float) and sync timeouts
# Details:
Address data sync timeout issues (extend from 30s to 45s), fix type comparison failures between Decimal and float values. Improve data validation logic and error reporting for sync operations. Ensure proper handling of numeric precision in comparisons.

# Test Strategy:
Test data sync with various data types, validate timeout improvements, verify type handling
