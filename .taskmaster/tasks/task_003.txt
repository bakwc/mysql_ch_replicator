# Task ID: 3
# Title: Fix critical process startup RuntimeError issues
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve 'Replication processes failed to start properly' affecting 40+ tests
# Details:
Root cause: DB/Binlog runner processes exiting with code 1 during startup. Process health checks failing after 2s initialization wait. Investigate subprocess startup sequence, improve error diagnostics, implement more robust process initialization with better timeout handling and retry logic.

# Test Strategy:
Test process startup in isolation, verify error handling, validate timeout improvements
